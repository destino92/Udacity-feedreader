# Project Overview

This is a project that was part of my [front-end nanodegree](https://www.udacity.com/course/front-end-web-developer-nanodegree--nd001). I was given starter code and asked to implement testing using the [jasmine framework](http://jasmine.github.io/) for javascript testing.


## How to use?

1. Download the zip file or clone the repository on your local machine.
2. Run the index.html file in your prefered browser.
3. When the page finish loading if you scroll down you will be able to see the test suite.


## Extra

For extra credit i have added two extra test in The menu suite.

* should have a list that contains 4 links
* it should be hidden when one of the link is clicked
